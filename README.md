Hi! I'm Ravi Shah, a Computer Engineering student at UT Austin. I'm interested in the intersection of embedded systems and space exploration.

I specialize in writing mission-critical, flight-ready embedded software for spacecraft, and I've led the bringup of several devices on a custom satellite bus, from fine sun sensors and thruster gimbal controllers to a Rust hardware abstraction layer for a rad-hard microcontroller. I also enjoy designing tightly integrated hardware, with extensive experience in prototyping, PCB design, and systems integration.

I have experience with several embedded languages, including C, Rust, and C++ for bare-metal, RTOS, and embedded Linux (NixOS) platforms. I thrive in a collaborative development environment, contributing to regular code and design reviews, with extensive Git and CI/CD experience. 

I'm always looking for opportunities to collaborate and work on innovative projects, so please feel free to reach out at ravi.shah@utexas.edu!
